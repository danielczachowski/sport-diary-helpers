# Sport Diary Helper functions
This web app is just a collection of tools to help with stats from
training. It takes the stats the user inputs and converts it to a nice
string, that can be further just stored in txt files.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building
```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
